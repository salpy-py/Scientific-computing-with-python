# Scientific-computing-with-python
Here are the projects I built to become a Freecodecamp.org Certified Python Developer. I love to play with Python and Data science tool. 

In the given projects, I also attached the README.MD file which are basically instructions by Quincy Larson to the specific project, along with that, I also attached the Unittesting to each project, so you can have better understanding who wants to create these projects at their own.

Happy Coding :-)
